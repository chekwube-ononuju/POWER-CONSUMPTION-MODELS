## Introduction

The POWER-CONSUMPTION-MODELS project aims to develop predictive models to analyze and forecast power consumption. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can help in efficient energy management, reducing costs, and planning future energy needs.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Various machine learning models for prediction
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/POWER-CONSUMPTION-MODELS.git
cd POWER-CONSUMPTION-MODELS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the models and scripts provided. Here's a basic example of how to run the preprocessing script and train a model.

```bash
python preprocess_data.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/clean_data.csv
python train_model.py --input data/clean_data.csv --model_output models/power_model.pkl
```

## Data

The data used in this project should be placed in the `data` directory. It includes historical power consumption data with features such as:

- Timestamp
- Power consumption values
- Weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.)


Sure, here is the updated section including the SVM model description:

## Model Description

This project includes several machine learning models for predicting power consumption:

1. **Linear Regression**: A basic model for establishing a baseline. It models the relationship between the dependent variable (power consumption) and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that improves prediction accuracy by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning model used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, SVM is used for regression (SVR). It works by finding the hyperplane that best fits the data in a high-dimensional space and is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.


## Results

The results of the models, including their performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²), are documented in the `results` directory. Visualization of predictions versus actual values can also be found in this directory.
